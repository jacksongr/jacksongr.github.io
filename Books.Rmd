These are my favourite books that I’ve read over the past 3 years, since I started keeping a record of what I’ve been reading.  I’ve gone for some separation of categories to make it easier to peruse.  

## Special Categories
These authors are separated from the other lists because their work is so consistently good (to my taste), that they would otherwise dominate my lists.
